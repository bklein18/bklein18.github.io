# Hi, I'm Brady

I'm a sophomore computer science student at the [Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management][raikes] at the University of Nebraska Lincoln. In addition to my major in computer science, I also have minors in business, mathematics, and physics. I work at [NIMBUS Labs][nimbus] on campus as a research intern, and I also tutor calculus and physics in my free time. Outside of academics and work, I'm the treasurer for the UNL ballroom dance company and I'm a representative on my resident hall association and on the Raikes School student advisory board. In my free time, I play Dungeons and Dragons, write, play video games, and rock climb.

My main area of interest in computer science is machine learning and artificial intelligence. I'd love for you to get in contact with me at [brady@bradyklein.com][email] or check out my resume [here][resume].
