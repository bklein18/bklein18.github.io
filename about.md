# Hi, I'm Brady

I'm a junior computer science student at the [Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management][raikes] at the University of Nebraska Lincoln.
In addition to my major in computer science, I also have minors in business, mathematics, and physics.
I worked at [Zillow Group][zillow] in San Francisco as a Software Engineering intern for the summer of 2019 and 2020, and I also work at the startup [BasicBlock][basicblock] part time doing data science and development.
Outside of academics and work, I'm a representative on my resident hall association and on the Raikes School student advisory board.
In my free time, I play Dungeons and Dragons, write, play video games, and rock climb.

My main area of interest in computer science is machine learning and web design (including both front-end and back-end work). 
I'd love for you to get in contact with me at [brady@bradyklein.com][email] or check out my resume [here][resume]. Also, feel free to check out my [Github][github] to see some of my side projects.
