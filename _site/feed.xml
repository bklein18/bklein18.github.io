&lt;p&gt;The Greek writers seem to have some sort of obsession with dissatisfaction leading back to ruin. There’s the tale of Icarus flying too close to the sun, as well as Pandora’s box. In fact, being satisfied is considered by many people to be a virtue. Some Christian preachers once taught that we were given a certain lot in life, and that we &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; pray for forgiveness from an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRqrLbgL3cAhUJQ60KHbjwBIMQFgg7MAE&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jonathan-edwards.org%2FSinners.pdf&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw25oLwfCFfG06_0yaC5OCx7&quot;&gt;angry God&lt;/a&gt;. Slavers taught their slaves that they were born to serve, that they should be satisfied with what they had. Buddhism teaches that desires should be eliminated from the mind in order to attain enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed these sorts of stories and teachings for a long time, but I never really &lt;em&gt;got&lt;/em&gt; them, insofar as I couldn’t understand why people would want to be satisfied in life. As you might have guessed from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/iLnyjk&quot;&gt;title&lt;/a&gt; of this post, I not only love the musical &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt;, but I really identify with the struggle that the titular character faces. Hamilton didn’t know how to be satisfied with his life. There was always something new to do, some battle to be fought. That was a good attitude to have, until he actually had the things for which he was fighting. His desire kept him alive and helped him, until finally he desired something that was out of reach, and had tragedy befall him as a result, a la Icarus. Not only that, but his desires harmed those he loved. His desire to start a national bank indirectly caused his son’s death (the national bank was unpopular, his son was arrogant, and challenged a detractor to a duel, where his son was killed) and caused his temporary estrangement from his wife through the Reynolds Pamphlet (at this point, I’m going to stop linking the Hamilton songs I reference, and just tell you to listen the musical).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the question I asked myself was the following: &lt;em&gt;How do we know when to “turn off” our desire, and furthermore,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;we turn off our desire?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but I think that’s a pretty hard question to answer. On one hand, we as a people have been taught these stories time and time again; history shows us plenty of examples of desire going too far, and “those that do not remember their past are condemned to repeat their mistakes.” But on the other, maybe the lesson isn’t that dissatisfaction is the enemy, but rather that it’s a tool. I believe that, when controlled, dissatisfaction leads to great things. Though Hamilton’s mistakes devastated his personal life, we &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; use his economic system today. The National Bank is such a good idea, most developed nations followed suit. Despite the fact that numerous Democratic-Republicans tried to undo the system, they failed. In that sense, Hamilton is a hero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desire can make people richer than their wildest dreams, as it does in &lt;em&gt;The Wolf of Wall Street&lt;/em&gt;, which is based on a true story, or in &lt;em&gt;The Secret of My Success&lt;/em&gt;, not based on a true story. The American Dream is someone who comes from nothing is able to make something of themselves. Tech startups across the nation have come to be multibillion dollar companies. Think about Microsoft starting from nothing, or Apple starting in a garage. The common factor between all of them is a fundamental dissatisfaction with their place in life, a desire to change the way things worked; in fact, a recent book on the subject of innovation was titled &lt;em&gt;Move Fast and Break Things&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest thing I’ve learned from thinking about the subject is that the most influential conflict of this decade won’t be the US and Russia. or the US and North Korea, or any manmade conflict. Rather, this decade has been characterized by a fundamental shift (a pivot, if you’ll pardon my business terminology) of ideas. In 2010, we still were trapped in the way that people have thought for thousands of years. In 2018, plenty of people are still in the mindset of satisfaction, and patience. We’ll call those people Burrs. But, more and more people are beginning to prize dissatisfaction and disruptive thinking. Those people we’ll call Hamiltons. Burrs and Hamiltons approach life fundamentally differently, and I believe that they sort that way because of a specific reason: their locus of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Locus of Control is a psychological term which describes how people view and interact with the world. Burrs have what’s called an external locus of control; they view the world around them as responsible for what happens to them. To a degree, I agree. There are certain aspects of your life that you have no control over, such as what color skin you’re born with and who your parents are. But Hamiltons have an internal locus of control, meaning they view themselvs as being responsible for their own actions and whatever  happens to them, they tend to take as being their fault. Again, there are parts of this philosophy that I agree with. I think that people do have agency, that they can change their future. Overall, I think both need to be taken with a grain of salt, but in the end, Hamlitons are the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether the Hamiltonian philosophy is right or wrong, I have no idea. But I can read the writing on the walls. In the game of modern life, you innovate, or you die.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="random" /><summary type="html">You have married an Icarus; he has flown to close to the sun</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">I’m Kind of WEIRD</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/academics/2018/07/24/people-are-weird.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I'm Kind of WEIRD" /><published>2018-07-24T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-07-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/academics/2018/07/24/people-are-weird</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/academics/2018/07/24/people-are-weird.html">&lt;p&gt;So to fulfill a requirement outside my major, I decided to take Introduction to Anthropology this summer. It’s an online course, so the whole idea of self studying in and of itself is a little weird.
I also thought that to a degree, I’d have a hard time actually motivating myself to actually complete the work, but, to my surprise, the material was interesting enough that I actually completed much of
it ahead of time. I guess this really should not have come as much a surprise, considering I’d taken courses in psychology and sociology before and enjoyed them, but for some reason, anthropology seemed,
well, &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;. Maybe it’s because anthropology is just on a larger scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a project in that anthroplogy class, I was required to observe a mixed gender group of 4 or more people and record which person was the dominant speaker during each minute for 30 minutes. Even though,
in reality, it wasn’t that long, I felt strange being an observer in a kind of interaction that I normally am much more involved in, as I’m a pretty talkative person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t even bother sharing the results because they were so specific that they could never be generalized to a statement of scientific value, but suffice it to say, the results were about what I expected, which brings an interesting idea to mind. In my 19 years of life, I’ve noticed that people tend to break your expectations when you least expect it, and when you most expect a departure from your preconceived notions, lo and behold, you’re proven correct.
The best way I can summarize it is that regardless of what you expect, humans will break that expectation. I think that’s a pretty uncanny ability to have, especially considering the 80 odd years of behavioral studies we’ve conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a scientist by the name of Joe Heinrich, the social sciences are overly skewed to weird people. Wait, I meant WEIRD people. WEIRD is an acronym used by Heinrich which means Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic; Heinrich says that WEIRD people are often the subjects of experiments because, often as not, they are the subjects available at universities. The people readily available have been mostly young students at the university for which the researcher works.
Because of this fact, Heinrich has been taking anthropological, sociological, and psychological experiments on the road to determine if non-WEIRD people behave the same as WEIRD ones do. Coming as a surprise to almost no one, they don’t behave the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason I bring that up is because I think that for much of my early life, I was exposed to my sort of WEIRD people. By that, I just mean that whatever I am, people were generally pretty close to me in socioeconomic status. But as I’ve gotten older, gone to college, and especially as I’ve met more people not from the US, my eyes have been widened so to speak.
Being raised WEIRD has certainly affected my outlook on life; at the very least, I’m more aware of my WEIRDness now, and I can try my best to take that into account when having a perspective of the world around me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="academics" /><category term="random" /><summary type="html">So to fulfill a requirement outside my major, I decided to take Introduction to Anthropology this summer.
