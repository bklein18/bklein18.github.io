  &lt;p&gt;‘I look at you sometimes,’ said Valencia, ‘and I get a funny feeling that you’re full of secrets.’&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‘I’m not,’ said Billy. This was a lie, of course. He hadn’t told anybody about all the time traveling he’d done, about Tralfamadore and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‘You must have secrets about the war. Or, not secrets, I guess, but things you don’t want to talk about.’&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‘No.’&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‘I’m proud you were a soldier. Do you know that?’&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‘Good.’&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‘Was it awful?’&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‘Sometimes.’ A crazy thought now occurred to Billy. The truth of it startled him. It would make a good epitaph for Billy Pilgrim-and for me, too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‘Would you talk about the war now, if I wanted you to?’ said Valencia. In a tiny cavity in her great body she was assembling the materials for a Green Beret.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‘It would sound like a dream,’, said Billy. ‘Other people’s dreams aren’t very interesting usually.’&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‘I heard you tell Father one time about a German firing squad.’ She was referring to the execution of poor old Edgar Derby.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‘Um.’&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‘You had to bury him? ‘&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‘Yes.’&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‘Did he see you with your shovels before he was shot?’&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‘Yes.’&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‘Did he say anything?’&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;EVERYTHING WAS BEAUTIFUL, AND NOTHING HURT&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‘No.’&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‘Was he scared?’&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‘They had him doped up. He was sort of glassy-eyed.’&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‘And they pinned a target to him?’&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;‘A piece of paper,’ said Billy. He got out of bed, said, ‘Excuse me, ‘ went to the darkness of the bathroom to take a leak. He groped for the light, realized as he felt the rough wall that he had traveled back to 1944, to the prison hospital again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Kurt Vonnegut, &lt;em&gt;Slaughterhouse-Five, or The Children’s Crusade: A Duty-Dance with Death&lt;/em&gt; (1969)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started writing this as I do with many things that I write: with a touchstone idea. When I was younger I hated writing, and it was so difficult for me, I’m sure mostly because I hated it so much.
But now, I realized it was because I was trying to write the way I was actually taught to by my teachers. That’s not how it works for me.
When I try to fit the formulaic writing strategies taught in public schools, I end up sounding passionless and voiceless. I become too objective and removed from the piece to have any sort of personal touch to my writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what I’m good at is writing about an idea. I think that it works for me because that’s the way I actually think.
I’m not the kind of person who can follow a train of thought down one path, and I think it’s partially because of my OCD. My brain gets trapped in loops and obsessions; if it’s not trapped in a loop, then it seems to branch incessantly, starting with Kurt Vonnegut and ending up with something seemingly unrelated, or related only tangentially like Dungeons and Dragons (I spend a lot of time thinking about D&amp;amp;D, so I’m not sure this is a good example, but, so it goes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I decided to write this because of a single sentence: “Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt.” I’ve read Slaughterhouse-Five before, but this phrase didn’t get stuck in my head until I listened to the song of the same name by &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/5J9na3tuaNRok2UrgTqzGY?si=ONLRb-iWTYuiUySmiUHE_g&quot;&gt;Hallucinogenius&lt;/a&gt;.
For whatever reason, my brain picked that phrase out as important. I’ve been thinking about it myself, and seeing what others think about it, but I realized something in doing so. It is because the meaning is so subject to interpretation that it has meaning.
Just like any piece of art, words and phrases are meaningful to different people for different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can already hear your thoughts: “Congratulations, Brady, you just said what may be the most obvious observation about art in the history of the planet. DISLIKE. UNSUBSCRIBE. #FakeNews.”
Hold on just a second, there. I have more to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am interested in why the ambiguity of something seems to make it more interesting. I think that humans seek in most aspects of their life to outlive their time on the planet. Even the most conservative estimates of the world’s age say that it’s only a few thousands of years old. You may be saying, “Brady, what about Last Thursdayism?!?!” First of all, calm down. You’re interrupting me a lot today. Second, even if the universe was created last Thursday, we were created with the belief that we would die and that our lifespan would only be a fraction of our universe’s history. Incomparable, in length.
So assuming that our lives are essentially meaningless in the scheme of things, we all seek to be carried on in our legacy. We try to force our arbitrary version of order on the world.
Why then, do we seek out these cryptic thoughts that defy our desire to be easily classifiable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that it is because they are ephemeral. They have no set meaning or order. They can change in an instant.
In essence, we seek them out because they are us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all of our posturing about making a difference and bringing order into the world, we know that order isn’t the world’s resting state. In fact, it is the opposite.
You can thank the Second Law of Thermodynamics. We know the entropy of the universe only increases in sum. Sure, some isolated systems may increase in entropy, but the sum total of the universe ever drags closer to complete disorder.
The heat death of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that we are beings of disorder and chaos, much as we like to believe otherwise. I think that the best art appeals to this sense of chaos within ourselves.
If I’m being honest, this is a somewhat difficult topic for me to write about. Normally there is some kind of valve I can turn inside me, and just begin to spew my inner monologue into words.
This is something that takes concentrated effort to consider. That is the other part of the allure of these statements.
The challenge of unraveling them is something that many people (myself included) relish doing.
But is it even worthwhile to discover what lies at the soul of these things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was younger and discovering fantasy and other literature, I took things for granted. Descriptions were just that, descriptions. They didn’t mean anything more.
A curtain is a curtain is a curtain, I thought.
What is wrong with simply experiencing the universe?
When you watch the stars at night, we don’t ask the stars why they are the way they are. They simply are, and that is the essence of their majesty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It defies classification. It defies attempts to understand. It simply is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this is not to say that interpreting some things is bad. Interpretation is the essence of what makes the mysterious meaningful, and also meaningless. It can be what you want. Poo-tee-weet?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="life" /><category term="language" /><category term="philosophy" /><summary type="html">‘I look at you sometimes,’ said Valencia, ‘and I get a funny feeling that you’re full of secrets.’ ‘I’m not,’ said Billy.

I grew into my current self due in large part to how much I played the game.
I talk about it constantly, I’m sure to the dismay of those around me who aren’t into the game.
But now, I’m realizing something: I’m a little burned out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say that I’m going to stop playing games or even that I’ll stop playing D&amp;amp;D in general, but I realized over the summer that I missed being a player.
I love being the resident Dungeon Master in my group, and I wouldn’t trade it for anything.
But it’s hard.
I’m playing in two different campaigns this summer playing a Kobold Abjuration Wizard and a Rock Gnome Artificer, and I think that playing Gutless and Dingle, respectively, has been some of the most fun I’ve had playing D&amp;amp;D for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when I was staring preparations for the new campaign for my group in the fall, I happened upon Numenera. I &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; recommend looking into it, if you’re the RPG playing type, but I won’t waste too much time dsecribing it.
Suffice it to say that a change in the perspective through which I viewed tabletop roleplaying games reminded me about every reason that I wanted to be a game master in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="life" /><category term="dungeons" /><category term="dragons" /><summary type="html">As you might know if you’ve read my posts before, or if you just know me, I’m a huge fan of Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition.

My sophomore year was quite the whirlwind, I barely had time to think for most of it. So, I guess I’ll start with a few updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m working in San Francisco now. Yeah, I was surprised too. 
I was certainly a little intimidated at first, especially since most of the interns at Zillow are seniors or graduated from college, or even master’s students.
But, as I’m now in my fourth week of the internship and I haven’t crashed the website I’m working on (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trulia.com&quot;&gt;Trulia&lt;/a&gt;) I have to imagine I’m doing something right.
My manager actually told me that I was getting all the work he assigned me done way more quickly than he expected, so that really helped me to feel like a competent developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still playing D&amp;amp;D. That’s been a constant in my life. It’s pretty much the one thing I can do that always relaxes me and helps me feel energized for the week ahead.
Over the summer I managed to make a few friends at work and online through D&amp;amp;D. I honestly should have realized that would happen, because it’s how I made friends for most of high school and college before this, and you know what they say about history and repeating itself.
Especially now during the summer when my working hours aren’t “whenever the professor assigns the homework” I’ve found myself spending more and more time working on my campaign. I just finished running &lt;em&gt;Waterdeep: Dragon Heist&lt;/em&gt; before school got out in early May, so now I have the task of figuring out wht the heck I want to run for my group in the fall when we’re all back together. As a student of science, I figured the best way to do that would be with copious amounts of research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I bombarded my players with three rounds of google forms surveys to try and get a better idea of what they wanted out of a game in general, and also out of my game and whatever system we would use to play that game.
The results really didn’t surprise me that much but I felt better for at least validating my ideas and confirming my hypothesis.
Taking some inspiration from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/mattcolville&quot;&gt;Matt Colville&lt;/a&gt; I decided to start consipring with my players before the game started to really give the first few sessions some punch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the summer, and hopefully during the school year as well, I’ll remember to update this site more often. At some point I’ll add a few more stories that I wrote for my gaming group to help set the mood for the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I’ll just keep on doing … whatever it is that adults do. I’m still working that out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="life" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html">Well, it’s been a while since I last posted here.

That’s probably a cool thing now, but for a while in my childhood, the fact that you played Dungeons and Dragons wasn’t really something you advertised. Well, my friends and I did, but we didn’t really care what others thought. I played for the first time when I was 13, in middle school. A new kid had just moved to my school, and had been hanging out with my friends and me, when he first floated the idea. Of course, most of us had heard of it before, but had never played. We were nerds, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we all decided that it was worth a shot, so we all went over to his house after school got out that Friday, and started making our characters. I don’t actually remember much from that session, except that I was a Half-Elf Ranger who dual-wielded shortswords named Braedon. But I do remember that we kept on playing. The story was loosely based on The Hobbit, so I had a good time. We kept on playing, and we were kind of bad because we never had time to do full campaigns, so we mostly did one-shots, new charaters each time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We couldn’t get enough of the one-shot lifestyle, and it happened that many of us had the same lunch period once we got into high school, so, being the nerds we were, we decided to do one-shots at lunch time. I think that 90% of the reason I still play D&amp;amp;D is because of those short sessions. We all took turns improvising stories for everyone else to go through quickly. In between eating, we got to fight zombies, solve puzzles and riddles, and explore dungeons. It was honestly one of the most fun things I’ve ever done. We weren’t worried about good stories, or deep characters, it was just us having fun with each other in the fantasy world of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That went on for pretty much all of my junior year, and by my senior year, I guess I’d kind of gotten tired of never getting to play a character or do a story for more than a few times, so I found another group of less busy friends, and we tried out a longer term campaign then I’d ever done before. None of them had ever played before, so it was quite an interesting experience. Funnily enough, the summer after senior year, my friends and I played once a week every week for the entire summer, so I had quite a bit of Dungeons and Dragons going on that year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I’m in college, D&amp;amp;D has really become my favorite hobby. I DM for an ongoing game every week during the school year, and play in a different game each week as well. Every Thursday night at 9:00, I tune into &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtube.com/geekandsundry&quot;&gt;Youtube&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitch.tv/geekandsundry&quot;&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt; to watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://critrole.com&quot;&gt;Critical Role&lt;/a&gt;, a popular D&amp;amp;D livestream. I own many of the books, I own miniatures (I’m not a very good painter, but I try at least), I’ve helped friends start up their own campaigns, and I love browsing and occasionally posting on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://reddit.com/r/DnD&quot;&gt;r/DnD&lt;/a&gt;. And of course, I always am on the lookout for new people to introduce to the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially if you’ve never played before, you might be wondering why I love this game so much that I was able to gush about how I got into the game for 5 paragraphs. It’s a good question. I’m sure that the game isn’t for everyone, though in the history of people who I’ve played with and talked with about it, only one person has tried it once and decided it wasn’t for them, which is perfectly fine. At least for me, I’m sure that some of it is genetic. My dad actually played back in the 70’s and 80’s, when Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson first began publishing Dungeons and Dragons. This actually surprised me at first, because my dad was the starting center on his high school’s football team, and if you talk to him about a lot of things, he seems totally against type. But then again, people like Vin Diesel play Dungeons and Dragons, so maybe judging a book by its cover isn’t the smartest choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another part of the reason that I like it so much has to go to my mom. When I was little, I was a voracious reader, and my mom did a great job of enabling my addiction by buying me whatever new book I waanted. I read all sorts of books, from The Hardy Boys to the Percy Jackson books, to all (read, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) of the Magic Treehouse books. The only thing I didn’t like reading was nonfiction. I know for a fact that my head has, and always will be in a galaxy far, far away. Even though I’d read pretty much all fiction, I think my first real exposure to fantasy where I just couldn’t put the book down was for the Septimus Heap books by Angie Sage. I read &lt;em&gt;Magyk&lt;/em&gt; in first grade, and I always eagerly awaited the next books in the series. I don’t know that I could list every other fantasy book that I read, but I’ll say this: in 4th grade, my school gave me an award for reading over a million words in the school year. As a frame of reference, that’s approximately the length of War and Peace, twice. Suffice it to say, I read a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that I always had read those stories, but I wanted to make my own. At its core, I believe that Dungeons and Dragons is about fulfilling and acting out the things that you can’t or are unable to do in real life. There’s an incredible play called &lt;em&gt;She Kills Monsters&lt;/em&gt;, and most of the “real” world characters have corresponding characters in a Dungeons and Dragons game. For instance, one of the characters who is in a wheelchair has a badass fighter in the game that she plays. Another character who’s a closeted lesbian plays an open lesbian in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think that it sort of scratches the itch that I have to hear stories. As a DM, I get to come up with awesome fights and characters for my players to interact with, and I think that it makes me happy to be a part of that. It takes a special kind of masochism to enjoy being a Dungeon Master, but I think that I ended up with it. You can prepare an enormous and cool dungeon to only have your charactersignore it in favor of a drinking contest at a local tavern. But then again, you’re there to ensure that no matter what, everyone is having fun, and that’s fun for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, I think that Dungeons and Dragons has been here for close to 50 years (in 2024, it turns 50), and I see no reason why it won’t stay for 50 more. People have continued to come back to their imagination and friends even when video games and movies have been more in-depth and beautiful looking than ever, and the I believe the reason why is because there is no substitute for sitting in a basement, or wherever, with your friends, eating chips and pizza, drinking soda, and having adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone who doesn’t know me personally has read this far, and feels inspired to try out D&amp;amp;D now, I’d highly recommend checking out your friendly Local Game Store, also known as comic book stores, and nerd-heaven. Most cities will have at least one, and they often have events that are made for beginners to try out D&amp;amp;D and other games like it. Or, if you do know me and you want to , let me know. I love including new people in my games. I think that inclusivity is actually one of the best things about games like D&amp;amp;D. It doesn’t care how you were raised, what your political beliefs are, what color your skin is, or who you love, or don’t love. It’s a place where you can leave the troubles of the world behind, and be whatever you can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="dungeons" /><category term="dragons" /><category term="dungeon master" /><summary type="html">Recently, due to a number of factors, the old-school tabletop roleplaying game known as Dungeons and Dragons has come back in vogue.

My high school physics teacher said that on multiple occasions, and I saw that it was true in physics; things in the world tend to follow simple polynomial relations. For instance, something as monumental as gravity is governed by multiplication and division. There aren’t any logarithms, or other complex algorithms. Pure elegance and simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, I didn’t understand how universal the idea of simplicity is. I believe Bill Gates once said that he would choose a lazy worker over a perfectionist any day, because the lazy worker would find the easiest way possible to solve a problem. But even beyond Bill Gates, the world shows preference to simple solutions. Many people in the US favor a flat tax instead of a progressive tax system, because it would simplify the whole process of taxation and close loopholes. I don’t personally know that such a system would work as intended, but I can understand the desire to find a fair and simple solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regularly, I would try to find convoluted ways of doing something just to prove that I was capable of doing so. If I had to guess the cause of this, I’d say that I likely did this subconsciously, since I’m a naturally competitive person, and those complex solutions proved my intellectual superiority. Of course, the idea itself is flawed, because I was just finding a way to compete in which I could win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I since have realized that true intelligence doesn’t make itself known through complicated solutions, but rather, in finding the simplest solution possible. If I wrote 1000 lines of code just to print “Hello, World!” to the console, I wouldn’t be smart for doing so. In fact, I’d be extraordinarily stupid. All I actually need to do in order to make my computer talk to me is to open a bash terminal and type&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello, World!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know, maybe that’s just a minimalist design philosophy, but I strongly think that simplicity and elegance would outclass clunky and complex any day. I actually chose this theme for my website, not only because it was the default, but because I felt like the other themes are just flash that take away from the important part of the site: its content. I could certainly write a huge, flashy, and fluid website, but I wrote this so that people could get to know me, not my code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually bought a game recently that drove the idea home for me. The game’s called &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s a pretty great game, especially considering it was entirely made by one person, and now, it’s a phenomenon. The subreddit r/StardewValley has over 211,000 subscribers, and the game was released to critical acclaim, currently garnering 97% positive reviews on Steam as of this writing, and getting ports to Xbox One, Playstation 4, and Nintendo Switch soon after it was released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premise of the game is that your character worked for a soul-crushing company until they couldn’t stand it anymore, and moved out to the coast so they could farm on the land they inherited from their grandfather. And then, after your miniscule introduction, the world is yours to do what you wish with. Want to become a tycoon of agriculture? You can. Want to adventure deep within the unexplored mines near town? You can. Want to revitalize a dying town? You can. The possibilities are seemingly endless, but the underlying design is so simple. You have a set of tools that you can upgrade, and the world is your oyster. It’s almost similar to another popular open-ended game, &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;, but there are certainly different aspects. &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; has a complex system of relations with NPC’s, and a heavier focus on gaining money as a mechanism to interact with the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without going into full game review mode, I’ll move on. Suffice it to say, I really enjoy the game. A relaxing soundtrack coupled with nostalgic pixel art left me hooked, where AAA productions like Dishonored 2 failed to really capture my attention. Sure, they’re fun, and I enjoyed them, but they just didn’t strike me the same way. In general, I think I’ve begun to notice that. My phone has a few essential apps I use all the time, like messaging apps, Reddit, Netflix, but apart from that, I don’t really have games on it, or extraneous productivity apps, mostly because I don’t need them. When I was in high school, I wore different clothes every day, to the point where I might have gone a month without repeating a shirt. Once I got into college, I decluttered. Granted, I still brought way more than I needed to my freshman year (as my roommate can attest), but I’ll continue reducing. I actually prided myself on my large collection of shoes that I got on sale, but now, during the summer and spring, I wear (mostly) one of my two pairs of Birkenstocks, during the fall and winter when there’s no snow, I wear one of my two pairs of sneakers, and when there’s snow, I wear Timberland boots. From well over 30 pairs to 5. Of course, if I need to dress up, I can wear dress shoes, but generally speaking, I don’t really wear anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve really taken this idea of simplicity to heart. Especially now, with information overload and FOMO and hyperconnectivity, it feels good to have parts of my life that don’t feel like they’re weighing me down. I think that’s a big reason why minimalist design has really gotten big in the 21st century. In the 50’s, everything felt sleek, and futuristic, which reflected the techcnological changes that the world was experiencing. I mean, there were people alive in the 50’s who grew up in the Reconstruction post-Civil War. Now, people have grown up with all the aspects of the future that make us tired of it. Many people have been trying to reconnect with their roots in various ways. In fact, there’s a large movement for Pleistocene Rewilding, which basically means trying to undo the damage that  humans have done to the landscape. For instance, wolves were hunted to extinction in Yellowstone, and that caused a series of ecological disasters. Deer became abundant, which lead to lower levels of vegetation, which in turn lead to greater levels of erosion, causing fragments and drastic bows in rivers. But, when wolves were reintroduced in Yellowstone, those changes reversed. Now that humanity has evolved to the point where we can live in the way we desire without causing harm to the world around us, we have a duty, I think, to reverse what we had to do to get us here; to return to a simpler time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="random" /><category term="random" /><category term="showerthoughts" /><category term="videogames" /><summary type="html">Nature tends towards simplicity. My high school physics teacher said that on multiple occasions, and I saw that it was true in physics; things in the world tend to follow simple polynomial relations.

&lt;p&gt;The Greek writers seem to have some sort of obsession with dissatisfaction leading back to ruin. There’s the tale of Icarus flying too close to the sun, as well as Pandora’s box. In fact, being satisfied is considered by many people to be a virtue. Some Christian preachers once taught that we were given a certain lot in life, and that we &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; pray for forgiveness from an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRqrLbgL3cAhUJQ60KHbjwBIMQFgg7MAE&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jonathan-edwards.org%2FSinners.pdf&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw25oLwfCFfG06_0yaC5OCx7&quot;&gt;angry God&lt;/a&gt;. Slavers taught their slaves that they were born to serve, that they should be satisfied with what they had. Buddhism teaches that desires should be eliminated from the mind in order to attain enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed these sorts of stories and teachings for a long time, but I never really &lt;em&gt;got&lt;/em&gt; them, insofar as I couldn’t understand why people would want to be satisfied in life. As you might have guessed from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/iLnyjk&quot;&gt;title&lt;/a&gt; of this post, I not only love the musical &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt;, but I really identify with the struggle that the titular character faces. Hamilton didn’t know how to be satisfied with his life. There was always something new to do, some battle to be fought. That was a good attitude to have, until he actually had the things for which he was fighting. His desire kept him alive and helped him, until finally he desired something that was out of reach, and had tragedy befall him as a result, a la Icarus. Not only that, but his desires harmed those he loved. His desire to start a national bank indirectly caused his son’s death (the national bank was unpopular, his son was arrogant, and challenged a detractor to a duel, where his son was killed) and caused his temporary estrangement from his wife through the Reynolds Pamphlet (at this point, I’m going to stop linking the Hamilton songs I reference, and just tell you to listen the musical).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the question I asked myself was the following: &lt;em&gt;How do we know when to “turn off” our desire, and furthermore,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;we turn off our desire?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but I think that’s a pretty hard question to answer. On one hand, we as a people have been taught these stories time and time again; history shows us plenty of examples of desire going too far, and “those that do not remember their past are condemned to repeat their mistakes.” But on the other, maybe the lesson isn’t that dissatisfaction is the enemy, but rather that it’s a tool. I believe that, when controlled, dissatisfaction leads to great things. Though Hamilton’s mistakes devastated his personal life, we &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; use his economic system today. The National Bank is such a good idea, most developed nations followed suit. Despite the fact that numerous Democratic-Republicans tried to undo the system, they failed. In that sense, Hamilton is a hero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desire can make people richer than their wildest dreams, as it does in &lt;em&gt;The Wolf of Wall Street&lt;/em&gt;, which is based on a true story, or in &lt;em&gt;The Secret of My Success&lt;/em&gt;, not based on a true story. The American Dream is someone who comes from nothing is able to make something of themselves. Tech startups across the nation have come to be multibillion dollar companies. Think about Microsoft starting from nothing, or Apple starting in a garage. The common factor between all of them is a fundamental dissatisfaction with their place in life, a desire to change the way things worked; in fact, a recent book on the subject of innovation was titled &lt;em&gt;Move Fast and Break Things&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest thing I’ve learned from thinking about the subject is that the most influential conflict of this decade won’t be the US and Russia. or the US and North Korea, or any manmade conflict. Rather, this decade has been characterized by a fundamental shift (a pivot, if you’ll pardon my business terminology) of ideas. In 2010, we still were trapped in the way that people have thought for thousands of years. In 2018, plenty of people are still in the mindset of satisfaction, and patience. We’ll call those people Burrs. But, more and more people are beginning to prize dissatisfaction and disruptive thinking. Those people we’ll call Hamiltons. Burrs and Hamiltons approach life fundamentally differently, and I believe that they sort that way because of a specific reason: their locus of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Locus of Control is a psychological term which describes how people view and interact with the world. Burrs have what’s called an external locus of control; they view the world around them as responsible for what happens to them. To a degree, I agree. There are certain aspects of your life that you have no control over, such as what color skin you’re born with and who your parents are. But Hamiltons have an internal locus of control, meaning they view themselvs as being responsible for their own actions and whatever  happens to them, they tend to take as being their fault. Again, there are parts of this philosophy that I agree with. I think that people do have agency, that they can change their future. Overall, I think both need to be taken with a grain of salt, but in the end, Hamlitons are the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether the Hamiltonian philosophy is right or wrong, I have no idea. But I can read the writing on the walls. In the game of modern life, you innovate, or you die.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="random" /><summary type="html">You have married an Icarus; he has flown to close to the sun</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">I’m Kind of WEIRD</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/academics/2018/07/24/people-are-weird.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I'm Kind of WEIRD" /><published>2018-07-24T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-07-24T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/academics/2018/07/24/people-are-weird</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/academics/2018/07/24/people-are-weird.html">&lt;p&gt;So to fulfill a requirement outside my major, I decided to take Introduction to Anthropology this summer. It’s an online course, so the whole idea of self studying in and of itself is a little weird.
I also thought that to a degree, I’d have a hard time actually motivating myself to actually complete the work, but, to my surprise, the material was interesting enough that I actually completed much of
it ahead of time. I guess this really should not have come as much a surprise, considering I’d taken courses in psychology and sociology before and enjoyed them, but for some reason, anthropology seemed,
well, &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;. Maybe it’s because anthropology is just on a larger scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a project in that anthroplogy class, I was required to observe a mixed gender group of 4 or more people and record which person was the dominant speaker during each minute for 30 minutes. Even though,
in reality, it wasn’t that long, I felt strange being an observer in a kind of interaction that I normally am much more involved in, as I’m a pretty talkative person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t even bother sharing the results because they were so specific that they could never be generalized to a statement of scientific value, but suffice it to say, the results were about what I expected, which brings an interesting idea to mind. In my 19 years of life, I’ve noticed that people tend to break your expectations when you least expect it, and when you most expect a departure from your preconceived notions, lo and behold, you’re proven correct.
The best way I can summarize it is that regardless of what you expect, humans will break that expectation. I think that’s a pretty uncanny ability to have, especially considering the 80 odd years of behavioral studies we’ve conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a scientist by the name of Joe Heinrich, the social sciences are overly skewed to weird people. Wait, I meant WEIRD people. WEIRD is an acronym used by Heinrich which means Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic; Heinrich says that WEIRD people are often the subjects of experiments because, often as not, they are the subjects available at universities. The people readily available have been mostly young students at the university for which the researcher works.
Because of this fact, Heinrich has been taking anthropological, sociological, and psychological experiments on the road to determine if non-WEIRD people behave the same as WEIRD ones do. Coming as a surprise to almost no one, they don’t behave the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason I bring that up is because I think that for much of my early life, I was exposed to my sort of WEIRD people. By that, I just mean that whatever I am, people were generally pretty close to me in socioeconomic status. But as I’ve gotten older, gone to college, and especially as I’ve met more people not from the US, my eyes have been widened so to speak.
Being raised WEIRD has certainly affected my outlook on life; at the very least, I’m more aware of my WEIRDness now, and I can try my best to take that into account when having a perspective of the world around me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="academics" /><category term="random" /><summary type="html">So to fulfill a requirement outside my major, I decided to take Introduction to Anthropology this summer.
