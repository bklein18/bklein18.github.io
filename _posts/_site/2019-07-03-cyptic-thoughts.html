  <p>‘I look at you sometimes,’ said Valencia, ‘and I get a funny feeling that you’re full of secrets.’</p>

  <p>‘I’m not,’ said Billy. This was a lie, of course. He hadn’t told anybody about all the time traveling he’d done, about Tralfamadore and so on.</p>

  <p>‘You must have secrets about the war. Or, not secrets, I guess, but things you don’t
want to talk about.’</p>

  <p>‘No.’</p>

  <p>‘I’m proud you were a soldier. Do you know that?’</p>

  <p>‘Good.’</p>

  <p>‘Was it awful?’</p>

  <p>‘Sometimes.’ A crazy thought now occurred to Billy. The truth of it startled him. It would make a good epitaph for Billy Pilgrim-and for me, too.</p>

  <p>‘Would you talk about the war now, if I wanted you to?’ said Valencia. In a tiny cavity in her great body she was assembling the materials for a Green Beret.</p>

  <p>‘It would sound like a dream,’, said Billy. ‘Other people’s dreams aren’t very interesting usually.’</p>

  <p>‘I heard you tell Father one time about a German firing squad.’ She was referring to the execution of poor old Edgar Derby.</p>

  <p>‘Um.’</p>

  <p>‘You had to bury him? ‘</p>

  <p>‘Yes.’</p>

  <p>Did he see you with your shovels before he was shot?’</p>

  <p>‘Yes.’</p>

  <p>‘Did he say anything?’</p>

  <p>EVERYTHING WAS BEAUTIFUL, AND NOTHING HURT</p>

  <p>‘No.’</p>

  <p>‘Was he scared?’</p>

  <p>‘They had him doped up. He was sort of glassy-eyed.’</p>

  <p>And they pinned a target to him?’</p>

  <p>A piece of paper,’ said Billy. He got out of bed, said, ‘Excuse me, ‘ went to the darkness of the bathroom to take a leak. He groped for the light, realized as he felt the rough wall that he had traveled back to 1944, to the prison hospital again.</p>
