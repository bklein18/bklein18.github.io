Recently, due to a number of factors, the old-school tabletop roleplaying game known as Dungeons and Dragons has come back in vogue. That's probably a cool thing now, but for a while in my childhood, the fact that you played Dungeons and Dragons wasn't really something you advertised. Well, my friends and I did, but we didn't really care what others thought. I played for the first time when I was 13, in middle school. A new kid had just moved to my school, and had been hanging out with my friends and me, when he first floated the idea. Of course, most of us had heard of it before, but had never played. We were nerds, after all.

Anyway, we all decided that it was worth a shot, so we all went over to his house after school got out that Friday, and started making our characters. I don't actually remember much from that session, except that I was a Half-Elf Ranger who dual-wielded shortswords named Braedon. But I do remember that we kept on playing. The story was loosely based on The Hobbit, so I had a good time. We kept on playing, and we were kind of bad because we never had time to do full campaigns, so we mostly did one-shots, new charaters each time.

We couldn't get enough of the one-shot lifestyle, and it happened that many of us had the same lunch period once we got into high school, so, being the nerds we were, we decided to do one-shots at lunch time. I think that 90% of the reason I still play D&D is because of those short sessions. We all took turns improvising stories for everyone else to go through quickly. In between eating, we got to fight zombies, solve puzzles and riddles, and explore dungeons. It was honestly one of the most fun things I've ever done. We weren't worried about good stories, or deep characters, it was just us having fun with each other in the fantasy world of the day.

That went on for pretty much all of my junior year, and by my senior year, I guess I'd kind of gotten tired of never getting to play a character or do a story for more than a few times, so I found another group of less busy friends, and we tried out a longer term campaign then I'd ever done before. None of them had ever played before, so it was quite an interesting experience. Funnily enough, the summer after senior year, my friends and I played once a week every week for the entire summer, so I had quite a bit of Dungeons and Dragons going on that year.

Now that I'm in college, D&D has really become my favorite hobby. I DM for an ongoing game every week during the school year, and play in a different game each week as well. Every Thursday night at 9:00, I tune into Youtube or Twitch to watch Critical Role, a popular D&D livestream. I own many of the books, I own miniatures (I'm not a very good painter, but I try at least), I've helped friends start up their own campaigns, and I love browsing and occasionally posting on the [r/DnD][reddit]
