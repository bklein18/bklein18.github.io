Brady Klein. *What is your quest?!* To make a difference through applying computer science, business, and hard science perspectives to modern problems. 
*What is your favorite color?!* Despite being a UNL student, I have to go with green. I'm a Michigan State Spartan through and through.

I'm not sure exactly what this blog will become. All I know now is that it'll at least attempt to document the important moments of my life. I might even forget about this site for a while. I haven't decided yet.

Also, for the uninitiated, reference [this][monty-python] clip from Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
