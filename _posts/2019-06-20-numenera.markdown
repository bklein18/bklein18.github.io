As you might know if you've read my posts before, or if you just know me, I'm a huge fan of Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition.
I grew into my current self due in large part to how much I played the game.
I talk about it constantly, I'm sure to the dismay of those around me who aren't into the game.
But now, I'm realizing something: I'm a little burned out.

That's not to say that I'm going to stop playing games or even that I'll stop playing D&D in general, but I realized over the summer that I missed being a player.
I love being the resident Dungeon Master in my group, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.
But it's hard.
I'm playing in two different campaigns this summer playing a Kobold Abjuration Wizard and a Rock Gnome Artificer, and I think that playing Gutless and Dingle, respectively, has been some of the most fun I've had playing D&D for a while.

But when I was staring preparations for the new campaign for my group in the fall, I happened upon Numenera. I *highly* recommend looking into it, if you're the RPG playing type, but I won't waste too much time dsecribing it.
Suffice it to say that a change in the perspective through which I viewed tabletop roleplaying games reminded me about every reason that I wanted to be a game master in the first place.
