On this page, I'll be posting stories that I've written, for a variety of things. I'll try to update it as soon as I finish each story, but they'll likely be updated only sporadically.

#### [The Slayer's Request][slayer]

A mysterious man called The Slayer hears of a treasure on a mountain, but will he escape with the treasure and his life?

#### [Invisible Worlds][invisble]

Inspired by the novel *Invisible Cities* by Italo Calvino, this story examines what our world really is.

#### [A Man of Boundaries][man]

I wrote this short story as a sort of "cutscene" for some of the players for whom I Dungeon Master. Rojax is a character who once was their friend, but had since betrayed them.
