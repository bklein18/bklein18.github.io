On this page, I'll be posting things that I've written, for a variety of reasons. I'll try to update it as soon as I finish each piece, but they'll likely be updated only sporadically.

#### [The Life and Times of Gutless][gutless]

This isn't really much of a story, but it's a small piece that describes the backstory of a character I'm playing in a campaign on Discord and Roll20. At the end are a few things that I wrote to help guide my roleplaying when I play in the game.

#### [The Slayer's Request][slayer]

A mysterious man called The Slayer hears of a treasure on a mountain, but will he escape with the treasure and his life?

#### [Invisible Worlds][invisble]

Inspired by the novel *Invisible Cities* by Italo Calvino, this story examines what our world really is.

#### [A Man of Boundaries][man]

I wrote this short story as a sort of "cutscene" for some of the players for whom I Dungeon Master. Rojax is a character who once was their friend, but had since betrayed them.

#### [Industry Analysis][ia]

I, along with 3 other Raikes students wrote this as the culmination of a semester long project for our economics class. In addition, we presented the findings to our class, professors, and a businessperson from Lincoln. Our assignment was to conduct in-depth research on an industry to present to people considering investing in it, and we chose to research electric vehicles.
