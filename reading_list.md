This list is going to be organized by month started, with month finished listed next to the title and author of each book, as well as how many words are in the book. Maybe this will provide some useful data, but mostly it's just for my own sanity.

## November 2019

| Title | Author | Month Finished | Word Count |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Anarchism and Other Essays | Emma Goldman | | 78,792 |
